# Wordle

This is a simple implementation of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) that
I'm using as a project to learn Rust with. It consists of a backend library and two frontend
interfaces to that library - a CLI version, and a web version made with Yew.

My eventual goal is to make a game called
[WordleEdit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auFAeZcyf60), and this project is really just practice
for that end goal, as well as a good way to learn Rust.
